" Once upon a time, there was a woodcutter, who lived in a little house in a beautiful, green wood.
One day, he was merrily chopping some wood, when he saw a little girl skipping through the woods, whistling happily, followed by a big grey wolf.
Deciding it was really none of his business, the woodcutter went back to chopping wood, until he heard a scream!
He grabbed his axe and ran towards the noise, where he found that he was too late: the big grey wolf had already eaten the little girl and her granny. "
